# AI Example: Alzheimer's Disease
This is a student project at University of Naples. The aim is the development and evaluation of an AI to classify patients affected by various stages of dementia and/or Alzheimer's Disease. We will focus on data inspection and analysis, then proceed on the realization of an AI through the use of machine learning methods.

The results are in the Jupyter Notebook [alzheimer.ipynb](./alzheimer.ipynb), which you can also find on Google Colaboratory.

Python libraries that were used:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
